# 🌾 Welcome to Grelien – Open Source Agro-Tech for the Future

**Grelien** is an open-source initiative to build a **fully autonomous, intelligent agriculture ecosystem** — combining embedded systems, IoT, ML, drones, and precision farming. Our goal is to empower farmers, researchers, and engineers with sustainable, scalable, and affordable agro-tech tools.

## 🚀 Current Project Status

We’ve **successfully completed** the first milestone:  
### ✅ [ESP32 Motor Controller](https://github.com/Grelien/Firmware)
> A powerful, WiFi-enabled motor controller with a full web interface, schedule automation, and persistent storage.

Supported Targets:
ESP32, ESP32-S2, S3, C2, C3, C6, H2, H4, P4  
Built using **ESP-IDF** and modern web technologies.
